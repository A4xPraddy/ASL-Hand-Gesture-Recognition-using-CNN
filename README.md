# ASL-Hand-Gesture-Recognition-using-CNN
Developed a deep learning–based computer vision system to recognize American Sign Language (ASL) alphabet hand gestures. The model is trained from scratch using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) on a large ASL image dataset and predicts corresponding alphabets from real-world hand sign images.
